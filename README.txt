A collection of reusable, general-purpose C modules that I use to jumpstart new projects.

The modules:
 - unittest.h: A lightweight unit-testing library. Slightly less minimal than MinUnit
               (http://www.jera.com/techinfo/jtns/jtn002.html).
 - qstring.h: Like string.h but with the landmines removed. A smaller and worse version of Bstrlib
              (http://bstring.sourceforge.net/).
